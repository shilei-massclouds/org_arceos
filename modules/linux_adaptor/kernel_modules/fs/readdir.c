/*
 * POSIX says that a dirent name cannot contain NULL or a '/'.
 *
 * It's not 100% clear what we should really do in this case.
 * The filesystem is clearly corrupted, but returning a hard
 * error means that you now don't see any of the other names
 * either, so that isn't a perfect alternative.
 *
 * And if you return an error, what error do you use? Several
 * filesystems seem to have decided on EUCLEAN being the error
 * code for EFSCORRUPTED, and that may be the error to use. Or
 * just EIO, which is perhaps more obvious to users.
 *
 * In order to see the other file names in the directory, the
 * caller might want to make this a "soft" error: skip the
 * entry, and return the error at the end instead.
 *
 * Note that this should likely do a "memchr(name, 0, len)"
 * check too, since that would be filesystem corruption as
 * well. However, that case can't actually confuse user space,
 * which has to do a strlen() on the name anyway to find the
 * filename length, and the above "soft error" worry means
 * that it's probably better left alone until we have that
 * issue clarified.
 *
 * Note the PATH_MAX check - it's arbitrary but the real
 * kernel limit on a possible path component, not NAME_MAX,
 * which is the technical standard limit.
