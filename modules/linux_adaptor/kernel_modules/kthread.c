/**
 * kthread_create_on_node - create a kthread.
 * @threadfn: the function to run until signal_pending(current).
 * @data: data ptr for @threadfn.
 * @node: task and thread structures for the thread are allocated on this node
 * @namefmt: printf-style name for the thread.
 *
 * Description: This helper function creates and names a kernel
 * thread.  The thread will be stopped: use wake_up_process() to start
 * it.  See also kthread_run().  The new thread has SCHED_NORMAL policy and
 * is affine to all CPUs.
 *
 * If thread is going to be bound on a particular cpu, give its node
 * in @node, to get NUMA affinity for kthread stack, or else give NUMA_NO_NODE.
 * When woken, the thread will run @threadfn() with @data as its
 * argument. @threadfn() can either call do_exit() directly if it is a
 * standalone thread for which no one will call kthread_stop(), or
 * return when 'kthread_should_stop()' is true (which means
 * kthread_stop() has been called).  The return value should be zero
 * or a negative error number; it will be passed to kthread_stop().
 *
 * Returns a task_struct or ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) or ERR_PTR(-EINTR).
